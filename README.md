# My Web Presence

This repository includes my personal web page created as a project for my web development class.

The aim of this project is developing a simple HTML page presenting my profile to a prospective employer. On my profile page, I can include information on who I am, my skills and work experience, educational backgrounds, and hobbies and interests.

This has assisted me in learning hands-on about:
- Writing and defining HTML
- Headings, Paragraphs, and Lists
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.13 Managing files in GitHub

-. Understanding the fundamentals of web development and version control The web page will be designed such that it is simple and easy to understand for those who are unfamiliar with HTML and the technologies of the web.
